civil engineering and geosciences (ceg),masters,no,9.0,8.0,"i think it will be appreciated if the university considers refunding some of the money to international students, since they haven't been offered the experience that they strived for.  try to establish a link between the faculty members with the international students in an effective way.   sadly, i think to some degree the professors are helpful only with international students when they are been recorded, while off hours they are quite helpful with dutch students.","i think offering the international student, first year master students more opportunity to enjoy the campus and their faculty facilities.  looking at your inefficiency in managing the current situation, you will come next year and offer the coming first year masters student, more opportunity to enjoy the campus, while us have to stay more at our rooms."
applied sciences (as),masters,no,5.0,8.0,"a break. constant assignments every week, exams and no pause between semesters, paired with essentially being locked in my room, make it so i did not really have any break, or anything to get my mind of the stress. anything else is secondary, even social aspects.","stop courses from setting hard limits on how many people you are allowed to simply work with on e.g. assignments. it is hard enough to have contact with fellow students as it is, and is harmful to both learning progress and social interactions. i have never experienced something like this before coming here, and i am really perplexed why some professors seem to think this is a good idea."
civil engineering and geosciences (ceg),masters,yes,5.0,5.0,"students which are working on their thesis right now tend to be more isolated than ever. lack of motivation is a standard nowadays. the university should have taken pro active measures from the beginning, not after a year without physical classes. large part of the student body feels neglected by the university, and ignored, to the point that students have lost trust in the institution.",create activities in the open or anything which can help students feel a bit less lost during these times.

"technology, policy, and management (tpm)",masters,no,6.0,6.0,"a student like any customer wants to feel that they are receiving a quality product/service. in terms of education its not only the content that maters but a big part of it is, how it is delivered. right now the tudelft delivery of educational content feels like its an open source library where each teacher does as they please. so there is a need for a standard that is uniform across different courses and that demonstrates the quality of tudelft as an institution.",make studying less frustrating because students have enough frustrations to deal with outside the university.
civil engineering and geosciences (ceg),masters,no,4.0,6.0,"the study load is not proportionate. i would well accept if all the material was relevant, but sometimes it feels like just added material. for example, articles on articles in which to deliver a concept they talk endlessly without getting to the point, not very exciting and not very effective in terms of education.","reduce the unnecessary load of material or improve the quality of it, it is just not engaging and in these conditions is just worse."

aerospace engineering (ae),bachelors,no,4.0,6.0,"there is a lack of effort from the tu delft to include people who are introverted into activities for wellbeing. personally, i think that tu delft really dropped the ball here because there are multiple things they can organize to fix these problems. the average student has always been top of the class and has therefore had little to no help. it is hard to change to an open attitude from one day to the other and this is somehow expected from us.","current times are different for all of us and i do not expect a handheld attitude from the tu delft. however, the lack of personal contact is starting to hurt many of us students. mentors for first-year students are not checking on how you are doing but more on how the project is going. when you are in a group of eleven you do not start a conversation with your mentor on how your personal life is going. this can easily be solved by planning more one-to-one talks with your mentor."

architecture and the built environment (a&be),masters,no,5.0,8.0,i think spreading the various options the university has to offer in terms of mental health is necessary as often students are not aware of them.,i think there should be more student councilors and they should be more accessible. i think there should not be a limit on the number of sessions either as often 5 is not enough!
civil engineering and geosciences (ceg),bachelors,no,3.0,6.0,it would be nice to have well-being programme as an (constant) on-going programme. there should be a team/unit of professionals that could only take care of students and focus on mental health at tu delft. it would be nice if our mentors would be more engaged in well-being movement.,organise a well-being programme every week - at least one activity per week. make more outside activities such as vssd did - with walk and talk.

aerospace engineering (ae),bachelors,yes,7.0,9.0,having to resist exams can be very demotivating and put too much pressure on students when they’re supposed to be focused on what they’ve learnt during the quarter. i truly think performance would increase if exam weeks came first and then there was a separate resit week with a possible few days break in between. this will allow students that have been affected by the ongoing coronavirus situation focus on present learning and not have a constant reminder of their poor performance during the previous exams while they have to do new ones.,schedule resit exams after regular exams in exam season.
